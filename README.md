[![Library Manager: STM32F1_RTC 1.1.0](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/STM32F1_RTC.svg)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/STM32F1_RTC)

## Overview
Allows to use the **RTC** functionalities of **STM32F1xx** based boards using external low speed oscillator (LSE).

This library can be used in the [**STM32 Cores** by **STMicroelectronics**](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32)
as well as in the [**libmaple** version of **Arduino STM32** by **Roger Clark**](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32)
development boards.

With this library you can use the **RTC** device to program actions related to date and time.
This library offers **Islamic Hijri** calendar calculations in addition to the **Christian (Gregorian)** calendar.
Day, month, hour, minute and second parameters can be supplied with values that exceed their respective limits or supplied with negative values.
Other parameters will be adjusted accordingly.

## Hardware Implementation
Per datasheet, If LSE (low speed external oscillator) selected as RTC clock then the RTC continues to work even if the V<sub>DD</sub> supply is switched off,
provided the V<sub>BAT</sub> supply is maintained. V<sub>BAT</sub> can be supplied with 3V external battery such as CR2032 through a Schottky diode.
For example, if using a cheap Blue Pill development board, the connection with the external battery can be seen on ***Fig.1*** or ***Fig.2***.

It is important to note, if you encounter problems with the clock pulses from LSE source, for example, very slow pulses,
then remove the **PC14** and **PC15** header pins which are directly connected to the STM32F1xx MCU
**OSC32_IN** and **OSC32_OUT** which increases the capacitance effect of the 32.768kHz crystal oscillator.
